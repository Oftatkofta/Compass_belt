This directory contains the schematic for the compass demo. The files are:

  README -- what you're reading now
  README-BUILD -- notes about building the circuit, including a bill of
     materials and information on substituting parts

  breadboard.jpg -- picture of my breadboard version (note nearly-invisible
     white wire from d7 to d16)

  compass.pdf -- schematic as a PDF document
  compass.png -- schematic as a bitmap

  compass.sch -- save file for "gschem" program (part of gEDA)

  HMC5883L-breakout-1.sym -- custom gschem symbols for parts
  matrix8x8-1.sym
  trinket-1.sym

  gafrc -- config file to tell gschem where to find custom symbols

Hopefully you know what to do with the PDF document and PNG image.

To load the schematic in the "gschem" interactive editor, run the
following command in this directory:

   gschem compass.sch

If you don't have gschem installed, you can get it on Debian-like things
by doing a "sudo apt-get install geda". (There are versions for other
platforms too; Google is helpful if you need those.)
