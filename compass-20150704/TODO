More testing, including under conditions of actual use.

The "TILT" indication sometimes doesn't show up when it should. The
"INTF" indication sometimes shows up when it shouldn't.

Use the top row of the display to show fine offset from the displayed
principal wind.

=================== stuff below here is done =====================

Does Trinket bootloader wait for USB when power is supplied via BAT input?
If so, figure out a way to speed up boot. -- It waits, but only for about
3s (instead of ~12s). That's probably OK for now.

Display TILT indication if the current (transformed) reading is too far
from the Z=0 plane. -- Done.

Display INTF indication if the current (transformed) reading is too far
from the unit circle. -- Done.

Implement temperature compensation (using the built-in HMC5883L
features). -- Done.

Implement HMC5883L self-test; display ERR indication if failed. -- Done.

Display ERR indication if the magnetometer is unreadable. -- Done.

Display INTF indication if any axis is saturated. -- Done.

Improve display. The font -- if you can call it that -- looks awful and is 
inconsistent. -- Now using word-style display inspired by Daniel Rojas'
tiny word clock.

Now stores calibration data in EEPROM.

Calibrate when requested via input pin. -- Done.

Allow user to cancel calibration in progress and return to previously-saved 
values. -- Done.

When reading is right on the border between two points, noise causes the
display to flicker between the two readings on either side of the border.
Add damping / hysteresis to prevent this. -- Added hysteresis.
