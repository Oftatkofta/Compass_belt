This directory contains the stuff for making the transparent letter grid
mask that goes over the 8x8 LED matrix.

The file grid is a plain text file showing the letter matrix used and
describing what it displays and when.

compass.svg is an Inkscape SVG (scalable vector graphics) document containing
the letter grid, as a 20mm x 20mm square matrix of white letters on a dark
background. It is based on the SVG from Daniel Rojas' "Micro-Word-Clock"
project, here:

compass.eps is the letter grid exported from Inkscape as encapsulated
Postscript.

compass.tex is a LaTeX document that prints nine grids on an 8.5x11"
page. It should be easy to modify for other media sizes. (Aside: I tried
doing a print version in LibreOffice, but it rasterized badly and looked
pixelated when printed. The LaTeX version seems to come out a lot better.)

The Makefile has the following targets:
	all -- build a printable compass.pdf from compass.eps and compass.tex
	clean -- remove all the temporary files
