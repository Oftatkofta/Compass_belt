This is an example program that shows an approach to calibrating a
three-axis digital magnetometer, then using the calibration data to
convert readings to compass headings. It uses fixed-point math, and is
designed around the idea of allowing for a very small binary size when
ported to the AVR.

More detailed information about this example is availble online:

To build, run "make" as a normal user.

To run, you'll need a Raspberry Pi with an HMC5883L magnetometer connected
to the I2C bus. (The code should be easily adaptable to other platforms,
though the hmc5883l.c module is somewhat specific to that sensor.)

Start with your vehicle/platform/whatever facing georgraphic North, then
launch the program. You will need to run it as root (or otherwise arrange
for user-level access to the I2C bus).

When instructed, turn the sensor slowly clockwise. (It helps if you have
a stable platform like a turntable, lazy susan or swivel office chair.)

Once you've made a full circle, you should see a stream of output like:

xfrm: -0.002 -0.105 -0.004
HDG: 181.791

The heading is in degrees, measured clockwise from your reference North.
The "xfrm" line shows the transformed X, Y and Z coordinates.
