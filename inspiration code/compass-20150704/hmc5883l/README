This is a small library for communicating with an HMC5883L magnetometer
from an AVR microcontroller, using the ../uWireM/ library for I2C
communications.

This is free software; see ../COPYING for details.

Note that this library does not yet perform temperature compensation. That
needs to be fixed before it is suitable for most serious uses.

Also note that the dependency on ../fixedpt.h is infelicitous and really
not needed; we're really just returning three 16-bit signed values.
