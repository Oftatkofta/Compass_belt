=== Wiring ===

   Tie the ground pins of the Trinket, magnetometer and display together.

   Tie the 3V3 regulated output of the Trinket to the Vcc of the display
   and magnetometer.

   Tie the Trinket I2C SDA (pin 0) to the SDA of the display and magentometer.

   Tie the Trinket I2C SCL (pin 2) to the SCL of the display and magnetometer.

   One side of the pushbutton goes to Trinket pin 1. The other side goes
   to ground.

   Power the Trinket via the USB input or BAT pin.

=== Substitutions ===

   Everything is 3V3 safe, so using a bare ATTiny85 is pretty easy provided
   you have a way to power it with regulated 3.3VDC. (If you program via ISP
   rather than USB, that will cut the parts count further.)

   Other AVR chips are probably usable wiuth some code changes, though
   you probably need more than 4KB of program memory. Nothing (other than
   the bit-banging USB in the Trinket firmware) is especially timing-
   sensitive, so internal clocks should be fine.

   Any HMC5883L magnetometer breakout should work, even designs that aren't
   5V safe. (The bare part is fine too, but read the data sheet carefully.
   There are some fiddly requirements for the nearby copper layout. You'll
   need a hot air station or a reflow oven for soldering.)

   Adafruit sells a bunch of different 8x8 LED matrices with I2C controllers,
   and any size or color should be a drop-in replacement (except for the
   multi-color ones, and layouts other than 8x8).

   Any other I2C display is a possibility, though you'll need to make some
   code changes. (Even if you use a Holtek HT16K33 as a driver, it won't
   be a drop-in replacement unless you map the LED positions in the exact
   same way as the Adafruit board.)

   An example minimal design BOM (with approximate single-unit prices):
      ATTINY85V-15ST     processor         $4.23 (Digi-Key)
      HMC5883L-TR        magnetometer      $3.30 (Digi-Key)
      HT16K33            display driver    $2.27 (Tronixlabs)
      KWM-30881CVB       8x8 LED matrix    $3.95 (Adafruit)
      MIC5225-3.3YM5TR   voltage regulator $0.90 (Digi-Key)
      T494B105K025AT     1.0uF cap         $0.84 (Digi-Key)
      T494B225K020AT     2.2uF cap         $0.84 (Digi-Key)
      2-layer custom PCB ~2 sq. in.        $10.00 (for 3; OSH Park)

   (Then add a pushbutton, enclosure and power connection of your choice.)

   Costs obviously drop dramatically as volumes go up. There are almost
   certainly cheaper viable alternatives for all the parts except for the
   processor and magnetometer.
