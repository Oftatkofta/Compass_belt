The first time you power up, or if you later press the button, the compass
will go through a calibration process:

"FACE NORTH" -- Do that, then press the button.

"TURN CW" -- Turn in a circle clockwise (to the right). Keep going until
you see a heading displayed, or press the button to cancel.

Once calibration is complete, the compass will remember the calibration
settings (even if you turn off the power). Press button to re-calibrate.
