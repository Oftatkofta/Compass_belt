This is an example program intended to demonstrate an approach to
calibrating a magnetometer so we can transform the readings to compass
headings.

This is free software. See COPYING for details.

To build, run "make" as a normal user.

You will need an input file containing raw magnetometer data. The file
format is one reading per line. Each line consists of three numbers,
seperated by spaces, with a bare newline at the end of the line. The
numbers are signed ASCII floating-point values, in gauss. The input file
must be called "circle" and be in the current working directory.

Example data is available here:

   http://mythopoeic.org/misc-files/circle

A program to obtain live data in the required format from an HMC5883L
magnetometer is here:

   http://mythopoeic.org/source-download/compass-read.tar.gz

To run, launch (again as a normal user) with no arguments:

   ./tst

The program will analyze the data, and report results to stderr. A
full description of the process is here:

   http://mythopoeic.org/magnetometer-real-data/

Note that you can uncomment dataset_dump() in tst.c to write out the
transformed data set to stdout (if, for example, you wish to graph it
with gnuplot).
